    "\n",
    "**Durability** ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter).\n",

    "Graph databases are optimized to store data about networks. Most graph databases are NoSQL in nature and store their data in a key-value store or document-oriented database. In general terms, they can be considered to be key-value databases with the addition of the relationship concept.\n",

    "\n",
    "In traditional relational databases, the relationships are defined within the data itself. In graph databases, relationships allow the values in the store to be related to each other in a free form way. This allows complex hierarchies to be quickly traversed, addressing one of the more common performance problems found in traditional key-value stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most graph databases also add the concept of _tags_ or _properties_, which are essentially relationships lacking a pointer to another document.\n",
