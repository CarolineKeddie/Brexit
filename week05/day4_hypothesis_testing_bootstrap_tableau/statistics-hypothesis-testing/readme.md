# Frequentist Hypothesis Testing: t-tests and p-values


---

### Core
- Understand the fundamental concepts of frequentist hypothesis testing
- Understand the difference between the null and alternative hypothesis
- Understand the t-statistic, p-value, and t-test
- Calculate the t-statistic and p-value by hand

### Target
- Visually represent the t-test and p-value using the t-distribution

### Stretch
- Understand how the t-test and frequentist hypothesis testing relate to the number of observations, the means and the standard deviations of each group
