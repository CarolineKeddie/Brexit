## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Download and manipulate a dataset, from the web.
- Work in groups, brainstorming approaches to get insights from data.
- Prepare a short presentation, using slides, to create a compelling story about your data.

---

## Instructions

In groups of 4 or 3 people:
- Go through the data repositories and decide on a data set to work on.
- Post on slack your group's name, the dataset you decided to analyse and a link to it.
- Think about how you are going to divide the work and share inside the group.
- Explore the data and its source to understand it.
- Use descriptive statistics to summarise the data and create interesting insights about it.
- In particular, try to come up with interesting relationships in the data. Any outliers? Any missing data? Do the distributions look normal?
- Use different kinds of plots to display information.
- Add any type of suitable modelling techniques.
- Finally, prepare a 10 minute presentation, with slides or python notebook.
- Your presentation should include (one slide each)
  - The topic/background of your dataset
  - The variables contained
  - Relationships among the variables and how you will use that in the modelling
  - Which models you fit
  - The scores of your models
  - Conclusions
