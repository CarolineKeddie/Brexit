# Evaluating Classifiers: The Confusion Matrix and AUC-ROC

---

### Core
- Understand what true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives are
- Understand what a confusion matrix is and how to apply and use it
- Calculate the most common classification evaluation metrics
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1
- Produce a classification report
- Plot a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

### Target

- Know when you would choose to change the threshold for prediction for a classification model
- Manually change the threshold for prediction and observe the results
- Calculate the ROC-AUC score


### Stretch
- Describe what ROC curves are and why they're useful
