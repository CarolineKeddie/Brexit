# Introduction to Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors

---

### Core
- Understand the difference between classification and regression models
- Understand the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm visually and in pseudocode
- Explain the differences between distance metrics and explore the two most common:
  - Euclidean distance
  - Manhattan distance
- Know how to apply KNN classification and StratifiedKFold with sklearn
- Explain what the baseline accuracy is

### Target
- Explain the effect of choosing K on the bias-variance tradeoff
