# Tuning K-Means and Cluster Evaluation Metrics

---

### Core
- Evaluate the results of a K-Means Clustering Analysis with :
  - Cohesion
  - Separation
  - Silhouette coefficient
- Understand inertia and how K-Means is fit
- Visually understand why inertia can lead to poor clusters
- Understand the importance of visually evaluating clusters
- Learn how to compute cohesion, separation, and the silhouette coefficient
- Plot and interpret the silhouette coefficients
- Learn how to use the elbow method with inertia to choose K

### Target
- Know when to use alternative evaluation metrics that are only available when true labels exist:
  - Completeness score
  - Homogeneity
  - V measure score
  - Mutual information score
