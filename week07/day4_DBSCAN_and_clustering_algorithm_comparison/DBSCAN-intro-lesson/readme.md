# DBSCAN 

### Core

- Remember the two main parameters $\epsilon$ and `min_samples`
 and describe how they are related to density
- Distinguish between core, border and outlier points
- Use sklearn's implementation of DBSCAN

### Target
- Describe how the DBSCAN algorithm builds clusters from any given starting point
- Identify similarities and differences with hierarchical and k-means clustering


### Stretch
- Carry out DBSCAN with sklearn, color points and choose point symbols according to cluster labels
- Evaluate the results with homogeneity, completeness and silhouette scores
