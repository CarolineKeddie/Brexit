    "Let's review these steps a bit further:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### IDENTIFY: Understand the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify business/product objectives.\n",
    "- Identify and hypothesize goals and criteria for success.\n",
    "- Create a set of questions to help you identify the correct data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ACQUIRE: Obtain the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal Data vs. Available Data**\n",
    "Often times we start by identifying the *ideal data* we *would* want for a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data acquisition phase, we'll learn about what data is available and any limitations it may have. We'll decide if these limitations will inhibit our ability to answer our question or if we can work with what we have to find a reasonable and reliable answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some typical questions at this stage may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying the right data set(s)\n",
    "- Is there enough data?\n",
    "- Does it appropriately align with the question/problem statement?\n",
    "- Can the dataset be trusted?  How was it collected?\n",
    "- Is this dataset aggregated? Can we use the aggregation or do we need to get it pre-aggregation?\n",
    "- Assess resources, requirements, assumptions, and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we'll need to acquire the data by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importing data from the web (Google Analytics, HTML, XML)\n",
    "- Importing data from a file (CSV, XML, TXT, JSON)\n",
    "- Importing data from a preexisting database (SQL)\n",
    "- Setting up local or remote data structure\n",
    "- Determining most appropriate tools to work with data (following the format and size of data)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### PARSE: Understand the data\n",
    "Many times we are given *secondary data*, or data that was previously collected. In these cases, we have to learn as much as possible about our data using tools like data dictionaries and source documentation to determine exactly *how* this data was gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Why might it be important to understand how data was collected?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A data dictionary is exactly what it sounds like - it's a set of documentation that explains what our data is and how it is formatted. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variable | Description | Type of Variable\n",
    "---| ---| ---\n",
    "Profession | Title of the account owner | Categorical\n",
    "Company Size | 1- small, 2- medium, 3- large| Categorical\n",
    "Location | Planet of the company | Categorical\n",
    "Days Since Last Delivery | Integer | Continuous\n",
    "Number of Deliveries | Integer | Continuous\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Tasks at this step include:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading any documentation provided with the data (e.g. data dictionary above)\n",
    "- Performing exploratory surface analysis via filtering, sorting, and simple visualizations\n",
    "- Describing data structure and the information being collected\n",
    "- Exploring variables, data types via select\n",
    "- Assessing preliminary outliers, trends\n",
    "- Verifying the quality of the data (feedback loop -> 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### MINE: Prepare, structure, & clean the data  \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, our data will need to be *cleaned* prior performing our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** What do you think this means? Why is this necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Tasks at this step include:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampling the data, determine sampling methodology\n",
    "- Iterating and explore outliers, null values via select\n",
    "- Reviewing qualitative vs quantitative data\n",
    "- Formatting and cleaning data in Python (e.g. dates, number signs, formatting)\n",
    "- Defining how to appropriately address missing values (cleaning)\n",
    "- Categorization, manipulation, slicing, format, integrate data\n",
    "- Formatting and combining different data points, separate columns, etc.\n",
    "- Determining most appropriate aggregations, cleaning methods\n",
    "- Creating necessary derived columns from the data (new data)"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "##### REFINE: Exploratory Data Analysis & Iteration\n",
    "At this point, you'll be conducting EDA - or *exploratory data analysis.* For example, you may perform some basic summary statistics and check the Mean (STD) or specific frequency counts of your data. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variable |  Frequency counts (%)\n",
    "---| ---\n",
    "Number of Deliveries | 50.0 (10)\n",
    "NYC | 50 (10%)\n",
    "LA 9 | 100 (20%)\n",
    "Portland | 100 (20%)\n",
    "Seattle 8| 100 (20%)\n",
    "Other | 150 (30%)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such descriptive statistics allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify trends and outliers\n",
    "- Decide how to deal with outliers - excluding, filtering, and communication\n",
    "- Apply descriptive and inferential statistics\n",
    "- Determine initial visualization techniques\n",
    "- Document and capture knowledge\n",
    "- Choose visualization techniques for different data types\n",
    "- Transform data"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### BUILD: Create a data model\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've fully cleaned and explored the extant data, we'll attempt to build predictive models based on the outcome we are interested in or the assumptions of the model we are using. An example of a model statement might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Completed a logistic regression using Statsmodels. Calculated the probability of a customer placing another order with the company.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are using a logistic model because we are trying to determine the probability that a customer might place a return order, which is - at its heart - a *classification problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the steps we will take to build a model include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selecting the appropriate model\n",
    "- Building a model\n",
    "- Testing and training our model\n",
    "- Evaluating and refining our model"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### PRESENT: Communicate the results of your analysis  \n",
    "Presentations are a critical part of your analysis!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't matter how brilliant your model is or how illuminating your findings are, if you are not able to *effectively communicate your results* then unfortunately they may not be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic form of a data science presentation should include - at the very least - a simple sentence that describes your results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Enterprise customers from large companies had twice (CI 1.9, 2.1) the odds of placing another order with the company compared to enterprise customers from small companies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** What do you think the CI stands for? Why should we include this in our findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, data science presentations can also be FAR more complex and exciting - like some of the [research presented by Nate Silver's 538 blog](http://fivethirtyeight.com/burrito/#brackets-view).\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a presentation, always *consider your audience* and make sure to *practice your presentation beforehand*. Try to plan ahead for the types of questions your audience may have or - better yet - test your presentation on a few people and pay attention to their responses. Clarify and refine your presentation accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, make sure to consider your needs and goals as well as those of your audience. A presentation created for your fellow data scientists will be vastly different than a presentation intended for some executives who are trying to make a business decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key factors of a good presentation include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize findings with narrative and storytelling techniques\n",
    "- Refine your visualizations for broader comprehension\n",
    "- Present both limitations and assumptions\n",
    "- Determine the integrity of your analysis\n",
    "- Consider the degree of disclosure for various stakeholders\n",
    "- Test and evaluate the effectiveness of your presentation beforehand\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A (Further) Note About Iteration\n",
    "Iteration is an important part of *every step* in the Data Science Workflow. At any given point in the process, you may find yourself repeating or going back and re-doing elements in order to better understand your data, clarify your model, and refine your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, after presenting your findings, you may want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify follow-up problems and questions for future analysis\n",
    "- Create a visually effective summary or report\n",
    "- Consider the needs of different stakeholders and how your report might be changed for them\n",
    "- Identify the limitations of your analysis\n",
    "- Identify relationships between visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "So again, remember that the *Data Science Workflow* is not necessarily linear, and may curve back on itself quite a few times during a typical project :)\n",
