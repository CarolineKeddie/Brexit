#### BONUS
4. Visualize your EDA and approach using at least **two or more** of the data visualization methods we've covered in class.
5. Create a blog post of at least 500 words explaining your EDA so far, including your results, setbacks, and lessons learned. Link to this in your notebook.

## Score:
Your project will be scored based on the requirements above.

- Remember, total scores are helpful as an indicator of how well you followed project instructions, but the most important feedback is to follow up on any actionable advice from your instructors for improving your project in the future!
