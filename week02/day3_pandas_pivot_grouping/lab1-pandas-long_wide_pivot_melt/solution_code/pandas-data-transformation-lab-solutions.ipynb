    "## Practicing Data Format Transformations: Long vs. Wide Format\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will practice going between long and wide formats in `pandas`, dive deeper into `.melt()` and `.pivot_tables()`, and explore the pitfalls of hierarchical indices that we covered in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that **long format data** is structured so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are potentially multiple `ID` (identification) columns.\n",
    "- There are pairs of columns such as `variable:value` that match a variable key to a value. (In the simplest case, there would be a single `variable` column and a single `value` column).\n",
    "- The `variable` column corresponds to the multiple variable columns in a wide format data set. Instead of a column for each variable, you have a row for each `variable:value` pair *per ID*. \n",
    "- This is a standard format for SQL databases because it makes it easier to join different tables together with keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "And **wide format data** is structured so that: \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are multiple `ID` _and_ `value` columns. In other words, there is a column for every \"variable\" with its own unique values.\n",
    "- The format has the conceptual simplicity of a single column of values per variable, as well as a more compact matrix.\n",
    "- It is not as useful for SQL-style operations: It can make it much harder or even impossible to join tables together on a value.\n",
    "- It can be useful in `pandas` when you need to perform operations on variables **across columns**; for example, multiplying columns together to create a new column.\n",
    "- It is the most commonly used format for data modeling (with some exceptions). I'll explain why when we get into the subject next week.\n",
