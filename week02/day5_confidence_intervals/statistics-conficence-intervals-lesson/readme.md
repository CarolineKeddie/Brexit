# Confidence Intervals for Statistical Measurements


---

### Core
- Understand the relationship between the mean, the standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean
- Calculate the standard error of the mean based on example data
- Understand the relationship between the CLT and the standard error of the mean
- Understand the concept of a confidence interval

### Target
- Calculate the confidence interval for a given dataset
- Understand how the confidence interval of a specified confidence level is calculated from the mean, the standard error and the standard normal distribution

### Stretch
- Understand how the confidence interval expression generalizes to small sample size for a normally distributed population 
- Interpret the meaning of the confidence interval and understand potential pitfalls of describing frequentist statistical measures
