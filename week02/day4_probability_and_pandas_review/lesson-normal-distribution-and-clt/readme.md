# Introduction to the Central Limit Theorem

---

### Core
- Visualize the normal distribution
- Understand the uses of the 68-95-99.7 rule
- Visualize the 68-95-99.7 rule
- Apply z-scoring to data

### Target
- Apply the Central Limit Theorem
    - Create random samples from a data set
    - Visualize the CLT by plotting the distribution of means obtained from different samples

### Stretch
- Use a quantile-quantile plot to compare a given distribution to the standard normal distribution
- Understand the limitations of the central limit theorem
