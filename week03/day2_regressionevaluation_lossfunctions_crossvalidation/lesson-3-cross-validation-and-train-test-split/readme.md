# Cross validation and train-test splits

---

### Core
- Describe train-test split and cross-validation
- Explain why we want to use these validation techniques and how they differ
- Split data into test and training sets using both train-test split and cross validation 
- Apply both techniques to score a model

### Target
- Use sklearn to split into training and test sets
- Use sklearn for cross validation

### Stretch
- Describe why it is useful to have an additional hold-out test set
- Explain when it might be a good idea to shuffle the dataset before cross validation
