# Simple and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) from Scratch

---

### Core
- Understand and code the loss function MSE for regression
- Write functions to calculate the R^2 metric
- Understand what R^2 represents
- Plot the regression line and predictions against the true values
- Understand the difference between multiple linear regression and simple linear regression
- Explain the 5 assumptions of MLR

### Target
- Derive the beta coefficients in MLR using linear algebra
- Conceptualise the difference between R^2 and MSE

### Stretch
- Construct an MLR, calculate the coefficients manually, and evaluate the R^2
