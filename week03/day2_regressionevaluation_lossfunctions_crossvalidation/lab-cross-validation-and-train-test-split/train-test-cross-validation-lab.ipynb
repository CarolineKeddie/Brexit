    "In the case of cross-validation, the model fitting and evaluation is performed multiple times on different train/test splits of the data.\n",

    "Ultimately we can use the training and testing validation framework to compare multiple models on the same dataset. This could be comparisons of two linear models, or of completely different models on the same data.\n"
