# The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

---

### Core
- Understand the concepts of bias, variance and irreducible error
- Learn how the bias and variance of a model relate to the complexity of a model
- Visualize the tradeoff between bias and variance.

### Target
- Understand the quantities entering the bias, variance and irreducible error terms


### Stretch
- Use data and model fits to get estimates of bias and variance
