# Intro to Bayesian Stats

---

### Core
- Explain what is meant by 'mutually exclusive' or 'disjoint' events
- Use & understand the formulas for:
        - unions (the probability of A or B occurring)
        - conditional probabilities (the probability of A occurring given that B occurs)
        - joint probabilities (the probability that A and B both occur)
        - the law of total probability (the probability of event A across all different event Bs)
- Use & understand the formula for Bayes Rule, including how we can re-write Bayes rule in terms of 'model' and 'data', to show the probability of our model given the data we have observed
- Be able to interpret the components of the Bayes rule with an example

### Target
- Know by heart the formula for unions, conditional probabilities, joint probabilities, the law of total probability, and Bayes Rule
- Identify the components of Bayes Rule by name: 'posterior', 'likelihood', 'prior', and 'marginal likelihood'

### Stretch
- Explain the difference between frequentist probability and Bayesian probability
