# Timeseries Properties, Autoregressive and Moving Average Models


---



### Core


- Get a feeling for how differencing can help reaching stationarity
- Recognize patterns in autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations
- Distinguish white noise and random walk processes
- Make use of past observations and residuals to predict further points in a time series with 
    - Autoregressive (AR) models
    - Moving average (MA) models
    - ARMA models 
    - Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models


### Target

- Apply different types of forecasting techniques (dynamical and non-dynamical)
- Score a time series model through AIC, BIC and MSE

### Stretch

- Infer the correct ARIMA model from the patterns in the (partial) autocorrelations
