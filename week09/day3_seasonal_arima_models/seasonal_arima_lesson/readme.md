# Seasonal Arima Models
---

### Core

- Plot the decomposition of a timeseries into the components of
    - trend 
    - seasonal pattern
    - residuals
- Perform seasonal differencing on data
- Examine the use of SARIMAX state-space modeling for advanced timeseries forecasting

### Target
- Produce a diagnostic plot of the residuals

### Stretch
- Conduct a Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity and plot the results
