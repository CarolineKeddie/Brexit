# Network analysis

---

### Core
- Understand what a graph is
- Describe a graph through its edge list and adjacency matrix
- Distinguish different types of graphs
 - undirected graphs
 - directed graphs
 - weighted graphs
 - bipartite graphs
- Extract the most common measures of graph characteristics with `networkx`
 - number of nodes
 - number of edges
 - degree
 - clustering coefficient 
 - shortest paths


### Target
- Get a first insight into network related questions like 
 - ranking (e.g. through degree or betweenness scores)
 - robustness (random failure and targeted attacks)
 - community detection (Girvan-Newman algorithm and hierarchical clustering)
