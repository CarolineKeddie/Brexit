    "[Zachary's Karate Club](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3629752?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) graph is a result of a social science field study recording if 34 members of a Californian Karate Club were interacting outside the club. It is a benchmark for detecting communities in graphs as during the study a conflict between the administrator and the instructor of the club lead to a split with some members forming a new club.\n",

    "This is data about how the most important Florentine families in the early 15th century were connected by marriages among the families (Ronald L. Breiger and Philippa E. Pattison Cumulated social roles: The duality of persons and their algebras,1 Social Networks, Volume 8, Issue 3, September 1986, Pages 215-256). In fact, the time covered is just around the time that the Medici family had been expelled from Florence before returning to power, and the families represented here are known to have shown opposition to the Medici family.\n",
