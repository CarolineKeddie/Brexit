# Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVM)


---

### Core
- Understand how the SVM builds its decision threshold
- Understand the concept of the maximum margin hyperplane
- Visualize the linearly separable case in classification

### Target
- Understand the math behind finding the maximum margin hyperplane
- Understand the hinge loss for SVM

### Stretch
- Understand how the regularization constant C allows SVMs to fit non-linearly separable problems
- See how the kernel trick transforms problems from non-linearly separable to linearly separable
