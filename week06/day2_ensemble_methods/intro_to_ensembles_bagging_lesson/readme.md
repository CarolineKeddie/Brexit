# Ensemble Methods - Decision Trees and Bagging


---


### Core

- Explain the power of using ensemble classifiers
- Know the difference between a base classifier and an ensemble classifier
- Describe how bagging creates different training sets with bootstrapping and fits a base classifier to each of them
- Use the bagging classifier in sklearn


### Target

- Describe
    - The statistical problem
    - The computational problem
    - The representational problem
- Describe how the bagging classifier makes predictions through a majority vote

### Stretch

- Describe how the bagging classifier can be stronger than any of its ensemble members
- Be aware that to make an improvement the individual classifiers have to beat the baseline and should not all make the same predictions
