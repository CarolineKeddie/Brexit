# Linear algebra: review of basic concepts with numpy
---

### Core

- Recognize scalars, vectors, and matrices
- Know how to calculate additions and dot products of vectors and matrices
- Implement basic linear algebra concepts in NumPy
 - create vectors and matrices (`np.array`)
 - vector addition/subtraction 
 - vector norm (`np.linalg.norm`)
 - scalar product/matrix product (`np.dot`)
 - identity matrix (`np.eye`)
 - transposed matrix (`.T`)
 - inverse matrix (`np.linalg.inv`)

### Target
- Recognize uses of linear algebra in machine learning
 - distance between actual and predicted values
 - least squares
- Check for equality of numpy arrays (`np.isclose` and `np.allclose`)


### Stretch
- Implement linear algebra operations through the use of lists
