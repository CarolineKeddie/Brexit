# Neural Networks with TensorFlow


---

### Core
- Get a quick overview of TensorFlow
- Build a linear regression in TensorFlow
- Tune our approach to linear regression to make it more efficient
- Build a Multilayer Perceptron feed-forward network

### Target

- Set up the layer architecture, cost function, optimizer and scoring functions for the neural network

### Stretch

- Use batch processing during the optimization procedure
